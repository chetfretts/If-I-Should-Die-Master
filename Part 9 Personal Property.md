Further Notes:
Other than money (which will be included in your will or trust) it is a good idea to make specific requests of personal property to avoid possible family conflicts.  Best to discuss things with your children or other parties.

You should do so prior to your demise, but if you don't do so, encourage your executor to convene a family conference regarding the disposal of items of seeming nominal value.  Let your children know who is your executor and that no one is free to "get there first and take what they want".  Your setting the tone of these events is the best solution.
