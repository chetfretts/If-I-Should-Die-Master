Material for this workbook is taken from a booklet authored by Donald Young and Benard Nolan.  

Obsidian is an app and an editor that uses a markdown language and produces documents that can be read on the internet.  Obsidian also uses links which makes it easy to navigate through the many individual files in the workbook.  Having this end of life document on the computer helps one enter the data, search specific data and update the data as life changes.

Note: I do not recommend that passwords be shown in this workbook because they can be read by anyone with access to this workbook.  Only the location of the password list should be given to the heirs or to the executor.

Here is the original front cover of the Young and Nolan "If I Should Die Before I Wake" workbook:
