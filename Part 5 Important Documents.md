## Special Bequests
What you leave is yours to leave to anyone or under conditions you may choose.  Consider carefully what special bequests (tuition, reward, encouragement or other reasons) you may wish to make.  Consider also whether or not you want to make a bequest to a favorite charity or church.  I so, you may wish to discuss this to see if a specific gift would be preferred over cash.

**Remember, all such bequests must be in your will!**
