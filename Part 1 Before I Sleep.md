## Planning Considerations
How people plan their estates is a matter best left to the individual.  In such matters it is probably wise to consult with a professional before adding an adult child to a property deed or bank account, or doing any of a host of other things that one may think will make distribution of one's worldly goods easier.  We can all recount stories of families divided by a car that some sixteen year old was promised by his dying "Gram".
    Do it right. Get advice!

That said, we all should take care that our last days are as free from the burden of possessions as possible, and that we are kept comfortable within the constraints of our personal desires as is reasonably possible.  Here are some things to think about.

### A. The Advanced Medical Directive
This is also called a "living will" and specifies what kind of treatment and the limit thereof (if that is your wish) that medical practitioners will carry our in your last days or in the event that you are incapacitated b illness or injury.  If you are hospitalized and conscious, most hospitals will consult you about these matters and may even provide forms.  You can also obtain these documents from a variety of websites.  If you choose this course, be certain that you get a state specified document and have it properly executed.  It won't help if you need two witnesses and only have one.

Make certain you provide your next of kin with a copy and that he or she knows the whereabouts of the original.  Also, provide one to the hospital whenever you are hospitalized for any reason.

### B. General Power of Attorney
This is another thing about which one may wish to speak to an attorney.  Once executed, such a document gives broad authority to the person appointed to act in the granter's behalf in all matters.  Great care should be taken to appoint someone you feel you can absolutely trust, usually a spouse or close family member.  You may choose the same person you appoint to act on your behalf in your living will (Advanced Medical Directive).

In concept, a general power of attorney allows the person so appointed to act on your behalf (without your permission); in all matters.  This person can spend your money, sell property and buy property. They can do anything you can do.

The reason for having a general power of attorney is to avoid a court appointed guardian in the event you may be unable to act for yourself as a result of illness, injury, etc.

Should you wish to restrict the potential actions of your appointees, you may wish to consider a "Limited Power of Attorney".  There are other solutions such as joint bank accounts.  All of these transactions have a degree of risk and should not be executed without consultation with a professional.

It is important to understand that a power of attorney does not survive you  These instruments are not intended to act in place of a will and may not legally be used after the death of the grantor.

It is of further importance to understand that banks, stockbrokers, and other institutions don't always recognize powers of attorney. Prior consultation is always a good idea.

Powers of attorney have been described as ticking time bombs and should automatically be revoked at a time certain, upon divorce or separation, incapacitation of the appointee or other such event.

No power of attorney survives the grantor.  Accordingly, they cannot take the place of a will.

### C. Limited Power of Attorney
(See the above General Power of Attorney)

### D. Organ Donor
Make certain that your desires will be carried out by making appropriate provisions.  This decision is often noted on a driver's license.

### H. Providing for Continuing to Conduct Your Affairs
Remember, this Part 1 assumes the fact that you are incapacitated and at least temporarily unable to conduct your affairs.  Someone will have to pay your bills and do other things that you would normally do for yourself.  Previous sections have dealt with providing someone with the authority to do things on your behalf.  This section deals with the mechanics.

How do you pay your bills?
    - [ ] By automatic withdrawal
    - [ ] By charge to a credit card
    - [ ] By check
    - [ ] By cash or money order
    - [ ] By electronic means
    - [ ] By a combination (if checked, you should check at least 2 other boxes.)

By Automatic Withdrawal:
    List all:
    (**Payee     Date of Withdrawal    Amount**)

By Charge to a Credit Card:

After completing this list, you may wish to close certain accounts (i.e. those opened to take advantage of no interest or low interest or another such feature).

### I. Persons to be considered in ministering my affairs.
You should think this through as word will spread that you are incapacitated.  This may lead to well-meaning individuals coming forward to offer advice and or assistance; some of which may be more welcome than others.  Accordingly, it is best to decide whom it is you wish to have authority, how it will terminate, and whether or not and how those persons are compensated.  Those persons would be well aware of the fact that your expect them to act on your behalf.  You may or may not make a special list for notification of incapacitation.  The suggestions in Part 2 below (who to notify of my death) may serve your purposes.

A suggested list follows:
    Employer:
        (**Name, address, phone**)
    Church and Clergy:
        (**Name, address, phone**)
    Family:
