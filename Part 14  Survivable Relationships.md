## Introduction
For example, if there was a document that names an ex-wife as a beneficiary. This situation may get messy for the heirs or executor to sort out.

The only way to avoid such problems is to use common sense and pay attention to detail.  Here are a few, but by no means a complete list of possibilities that you may use to try to make certain all bases have been covered.

## Review All Documents
Review all documents such as (but not limited to) wills, codicils, deeds, deeds of trust, deeds of gift, charitable obligations, adoption papers, divorce degrees, support agreements, trust accounts, etc.
    1. Ensure that only those that should be effective remain so, and all others are properly cancelled or revoked.
    2. Ensure that both you and your spouse, heirs or named administrators or executer understand all these documents.
**(All documents are found and reviewed: Yes or No)**

To the extent you have undertaken the care of (in any sense) family members who may be hospitalized, incarcerated, or in the mental health system, jot down what the obligation may be, why it is important to you, where appropriate papers may be, and who will assume responsibility after you are no longer available.
