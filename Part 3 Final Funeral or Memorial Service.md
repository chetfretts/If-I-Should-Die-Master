Prepaid or Preplanned Funerals
You may wish to consult with your funeral director about this course of action.  It can control costs ("Daddy deserves the best type of casket or urn") and give you the option of making your own choices at a time when sober consideration will dictate decisions.  Taking emotion out of these types of decisions is probably a good thing.  You can "comparison shop" among funeral homes.

Make certain that all items for which you are paying the funeral home to pay someone else (e.g. inscriptions, organist, soloist, clergy, etc.)  If that person does not accept payment for such service, reimbursement will be made by the funeral home.

The prepaid funeral is an option that people who are living alone and have no geographically close relatives may wish to consider.
