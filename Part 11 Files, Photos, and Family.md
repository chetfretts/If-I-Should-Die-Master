## Introduction
Much of what we do in these areas is done on our computers and as such our heirs should understand how to access your computer to retrieve what you have stored.  Most of our children and grandchildren are vastly more adept in their digital skills than we are.  This should not be a problem.  Make sure that it isn't!

However, what about that book of photographs that you took out of your parents home years ago?  And what about those other stove, dishwasher, refrigerator, etc. instruction manuals you have been saving for years?  This chapter is talking about items with intrinsic value.

## Word to the Wise
**If there are items that you want your heirs to have - IDENTIFY THEM or they will likely be thrown out.  If it is not important enough for you to take the time, it isn't important enough for your heirs to look for.**

##  Files
### Computer Files
The easiest way to provide access to your important papers is by computer.  All you must do is to ensure that those people selected to handle your affairs know the procedure to access the computer and know its file structure.
(**Document the computer access procedure and the file structure needed to obtain the important papers and photos**)

### Paper Files
There are certain things that cannot be computerized and paper records are required and exist.  They have been detailed in prior chapters, but here is a recap:
    Wills and codicils
    Trusts and associated papers
    Letters of medical instruction (Living Wills)
    Insurance policies
    Deeds
    Bills of sale
    Certain appraisals
    Titles to personal property (vehicles, boats, etc.)
    Stocks and bonds
    Papers relating to business relationships
    Certain Contracts
    Notes of indebtedness
    Note 1: If you have questions as to whether or not you should retain a paper record of a transaction, consult with an attorney.  (**Possible todo item**)
    Note 2: Tax files are usually retained in an electronic format by tax preparers, but not all do this.  You must be absolutely certain that your tax preparer knows that your files will be so retained. (**Todo item**)

### What to do
Physically go through your existing file cabinet, drawers, and or boxes and make an index of your existing files.  (**Make a file index**)
Note 1: Throw away old, out of date, or irrelevant papers.  (**Throw away**)
Note 2: Much of this material may have personal data, so properly dispose or shred it.

Go over your **index** and ensure that to the extent the list above is applicable, you have or will create an appropriate index file.

## Photographs, Color Slides, and Digital Photos
People listen to stories and connect pictures with prose, but have little interest in that shot of a parrot you took in (what island was it?). All of us have bored our friends and families with tales of our adventures.  We would be deluding ourselves if we believed they actually were of interest. So!

### What to do
If you are inclined, go through the boxes of photographs, trays of slides, etc.  Select some and inscribe them.  Enjoy the rest yourself.
    Preserve photographs of ancestors.  People want to know what their grandparents looked like.
    Identify and save those photos that document your children's lives, birthdays, baby pictures, sports, schools, etc.
    As for the rest, you're on your own.

## Family History
### Intro
Interest varies with respect go genealogical issues from family to family.  Some have excellent records and some can go no further than their grandparents.  All members of any family will be excited to learn what you have discovered.  In any case, to the extent that you have anything, let them know where it is, what it is, and how they can gain access to the information.

Take a few minutes to write down:
    Type of information (family bible, genealogical charts, photographs, anything written)?
    Where is it?
    How can it be accessed?
    Who has copies?
    How it came into your possession?
    (**Add the above information for your heirs**)
