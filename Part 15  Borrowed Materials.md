# Part 15 Borrowed Materials
## Introduction
A very dear friend of mine will tell you that for his age he's in great physical condition.  He will also say he is legally blind and subscribes to the Library of Congress "Talking Books Program" and has on loan both a tape player and CD player.  He also has a transceiver in his bedroom that periodically queries the defibrillator - pacemaker implanted in his chest to transmit information to his cardiologist.  He also has a medical condition that requires him to measure the coagulation capability of his blood for which he has a machine on loan.

And so it is that we are not just addressing library books in this section but very real and very expensive medical and other types of equipment.  You may have several such devices or none - in which case good for you.  In any case, list those that you have so your heirs will be able to dispose of or return them as appropriate.
