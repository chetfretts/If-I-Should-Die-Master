#ToAddData

When you die, income from many sources will diminish or cease, but expenses won't. Your heirs should have easy access to your sources of income and regular expenses. Often, all that is needed is the most recent copy of your bank statement or even the register of your check book.  If all of this information is in your computer, jot down how it can be accessed (See Passwords and Pins).
