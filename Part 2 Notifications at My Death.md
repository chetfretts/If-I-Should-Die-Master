# Part 2 Notifications at My Death
## Introduction
Much of this issue goes without saying.  However, your children may not know old college roommates, whether you want death publicized in publications (i.e. fraternity, sorority, military, club, Association, Homeowner Newsletters, etc.)  It's best to spend some time considering these things.  Also, we all have so many lists of  names (Christmas card, rolodex, phone books, PDA, cell phones, computers, etc.) that our spouse or children may not be able to determine who exactly should be notified.

Of primary importance is to have your wishes carried out.  Some of these concerns might be:
    Do you want a funeral or memorial service?
    Do you want to be buried or cremated?


## A suggested list to be notified:
The first part of the following suggested list is intended to accomplish carrying out your stated desires.

Whoever has your will::
    (**Enter list of names with contact information**)

Family Members:
    (**Enter list of names with contact information**)

Church and Clergyman:
    (**Enter list of names with contact information**)

Clubs, Societies, Associations, etc. of which I am or have been a member:
    (**Enter Club or Association Name     Contact Information**)

Christmas card List:
    Where is it located? (**Location**)

Cell Phone automatic dial list (favorites):  (**How to access**)

Landline automatic dial list:  (**How to access**)

Previous Employers:
    (**List of names with contact information**)

Previous churches of which I was a member:
    (**List of names with contact information**)
    
Other groups and or individuals I want to know of my death:
    (**List of names with contact information**)

Note:  This list is intended to notify those who may provide assistance or attend your funeral or memorial service.  Accordingly, it may be wise to have your survivors wait until arrangements have been made for such a service before notifying all on this list.  

Notification of other individuals, business, institutions, organizations, etc. will, of course have to occur in time.  This is the subject of subsequent parts of this undertaking and in some cases will require a death certificate.  In many cases, your selected Funeral Director can assist in this effort.
